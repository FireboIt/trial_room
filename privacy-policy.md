# Privacy Policy for Trial Room Chrome Extension

_Last updated: April 2025_

**Trial Room** ("we", "our", or "the extension") values your privacy. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome Extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

When using the extension, we may collect the following information:
- **User-uploaded image** (used to generate try-on visualizations)
- **Product image URL** (from supported ecommerce sites)
- **Active page URL** (to log where the try-on was triggered)

No personal identifiers such as name, email, or contact info are collected.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

Your data is used strictly to:
- Generate virtual try-on previews using AI APIs
- Improve functionality and monitor usage
- Log errors or unexpected behavior (e.g. API failures)

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- Uploaded and generated images are temporarily stored on our backend server for processing.
- These images are automatically purged after **30 days**.
- Logging files (e.g., errors, task status) are used for internal debugging and analytics only.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data with any third-party organizations. Your uploaded images and generated outputs are only processed through secured APIs and never used for training or external analytics.

## 5. Security Measures

We use HTTPS encryption for all network communication. Backend tokens and credentials are securely stored using environment variables and not exposed in the codebase.

## 6. User Controls

- You can delete your uploaded image at any time by clearing your local storage.
- No persistent account or profile is associated with your use.
